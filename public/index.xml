As a social scientist, I will also post discussions about anything that interests me as a researcher, or with interesting applications to my own fields (anthropology, cognitive science) or adjacent fields.
I am hoping this will be a platform for writing out and sharpening up some newer ideas, which might include migrating from disorganized text files in my local directories to a more public context.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>I study the cognitive foundations of culture from an evolutionary perspective. Human cognition evolved to process and respond to information about conflict, coordination, and socioecological variation. How do cultural patterns reliably emerge from these individual-level processes?
As a PhD candidate in evolutionary anthropology, my dissertation research asks how and why people defer to others, particularly specialists in science and religion, to help them make decisions. This research integrates diverse theoretical perspectives, including cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and game theory; and methods include a combination of empirical research, social network analysis, and computational modeling.</description></item></channel></rss>
