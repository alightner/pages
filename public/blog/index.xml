As a social scientist, I will also post discussions about anything that interests me as a researcher, or with interesting applications to my own fields (anthropology, cognitive science) or adjacent fields.
I am hoping this will be a platform for writing out and sharpening up some newer ideas, which might include migrating from disorganized text files in my local directories to a more public context.</description></item></channel></rss>
