I study the cognitive foundations of culture from an evolutionary perspective. Human cognition evolved to process and respond to information about conflict, coordination, and socioecological variation. How do cultural patterns reliably emerge from these individual-level processes? As a PhD candidate in evolutionary anthropology, my dissertation research asks how and why people defer to others, particularly specialists in science and religion, to help them make decisions. This research integrates diverse theoretical perspectives, including cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and game theory; and methods include a combination of empirical research, social network analysis, and computational modeling. Here is a [link to my CV](/about/lightner-cv.pdf).

When I am not working on research, I enjoy reading, music, programming, data analysis, and homebrewing. Do you have a question? Feel free to [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adlightner) or [send me an email](mailto:aaron.lightner@wsu.edu).
