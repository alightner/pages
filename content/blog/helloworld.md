Thanks for stopping by my academic weblog, which will be dedicated to reporting on new research, projects I'm involved in, and data analysis in R. As a social scientist, I will also post discussions about anything that interests me as a researcher, or with interesting applications to my own fields (anthropology, cognitive science) or adjacent fields.

I am hoping this will be a platform for writing out and sharpening up some newer ideas, which might include migrating from disorganized text files in my local directories to a more public context. I want the ideas here to be open to critique and discussion, because this is fundamentally a pathway to improving our ideas. Constructive comments are welcome, and will be helpful to improving the blog, and to suggesting new ideas and open questions. Feel free to send an email or reach out on Twitter.
