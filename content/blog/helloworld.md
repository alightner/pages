# First blog post ever

Thanks for stopping by my academic weblog. This will be dedicated to reporting on new research, projects I'm involved in, and data analysis in R. I also plan to preview my own research as it progresses. As a social scientist, I will post discussions about anything that interests me as a researcher, or with interesting applications to my own fields (anthropology, cognitive science) or adjacent fields.

I am hoping this will ultimately be a platform for developing or discussing new ideas and synthesizing information. A motivation for writing here is to migrate some of my own writing-as-a-process-of-thinking from disorganized text files in my local directory to a public platform. This not only requires me to polish my writing (sort of?) more often, but also, more importantly, opens my ideas to criticism. This is central to [reasoning](https://www.dan.sperber.fr/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/MercierSperberWhydohumansreason.pdf), and disagreement, in my view, is fundamentally a pathway to improving our ideas.

So comments are welcome, and will be helpful to improving the blog, and to suggesting new ideas and open questions. Feel free to send an email or reach out on Twitter, and thanks for stopping by.
